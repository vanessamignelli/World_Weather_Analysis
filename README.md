# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to utilize API's to examine global weather conditions to assist in picking vacation spots. Through leveraging python, jupyter notebook and API's, hotels were intentified across the globe that matched weather conditions specified by the user. Additionally, trip itineraries were identified that would map out a route to different neighbouring hotels. 

Below is a sample of the output. Different hotels and a route are mapped out for New Caledonia.
